### About this documentation
This documentation describes the RESTful APIs provided by the Adobe Typekit service to anable the integration of the desktop font sync feature 
into Adobe point products.

For API examples this document uses two font families: 

* Coquette (opaque id drjf) with Ligth, Regular and Bold variations
* Proxima Nova (opaque id vcsm) with Black, Thin and Regular variations. For 

Other font family and font variation properties use consistent but made up values and should not be relied on for actual database queries. 
Data which is temporary, such as tokens, is mocked up using all caps.

### Authentication
The API requests are authenticated by validating the OAuth bearer token issued by IMS and included in the request header. 
Since the token contains both the user id and the client id the typekit service can use it to authenticate the user and track the origin of the request.
The requests are valid for the duration of the access token.

### Request rate limiting
Version 1 of this API is intended for internal Adobe use. As such there are no enforced request rate limits

### Data structures
All request and response data is represented as JSON. XML is not supported.

The Typekit service maintains user specific selection of fonts which are synced to authorized desktop computers. 
While the user modifies the font selection based on complete font families the underlying data is font variation based.
The font selection API is therefore also font variation based thus allowing the client software to add a specific font style to the selection collection.

#### Font variation JSON object:

    {
        "font_id": "TkD-100-2jt9s6h8lq",
        "family_id": "drjf",
        "style": "Thin",
        "family": "Coquette",
        "links": {
            "self": "https://typekit.com/api/desktop_v1/font_variation/TkD-100-2jt9s6h8lq",
            "family": "https://typekit.com/api/desktop_v1/font_family/drjf"
        }
    }

#### Font family JSON object:

    {
        "id": "drjf",
        "name": "Coquette",
        "biography": "Coquette, designed in 2001, could be the result of a happy marriage of Kabel and French Script. According to Mark, \"The idea for this typeface got stuck in my head in the early â€™90s. To me, it feels like it has always existed, even though Iâ€™ve never seen anything quite like it. I am happy to offer this unique yet strangely familiar script.\"",
        "links": {
            "self": "https://typekit.com/api/desktop_v1/font_family/drjf",
            "html": "https://typekit.com/fonts/coquette",
            "purchase": "http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/mondosearchresults.htm?st=12&kid=Coquette"
        }
    }
####Font selection status:
Some endpoints need to communicate the availability of the requested font variation. The following constants are used:

* licensed - the font variation can be added to font selection
* synced - the font variation is already in the font selection
* not-licensed - the font variation exists but the user is not authorized to use it
* not-found - the font id does not match a known font variation
